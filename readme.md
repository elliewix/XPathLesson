# Fabled xpath lesson

This is a DRAFT of a lesson for the Programming Historian.  The scope is not meant to be all encompassing, but to get readers up and going with at least something to experiment.  Basic concepts will be introduced, but a thorough exploration of all possible functions and such will be avoided.

Also avoided is a larger discussion of what the python is doing behind the scenes.

Caveats:

* DRAFT
* much of this was written on top of a sleeping baby in 10 minute chunks
* the rest was written between conference sessions
* the newer stuff is being written at 2am during an overnight layover in London when I've been awake for longer than 24 hours.
* jupyter doesn't have spell check
